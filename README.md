#ColorTV tvOS SDK

##Getting started


Before getting started make sure you have: 

* Added your app in the My Applications section of the Color Dashboard. You need to do this so that you can get your App ID that you'll be adding to your app with our SDK.

* Our newest tvOS SDK supports the newest Xcode (7.2). Please ensure you are using Xcode (7.2) or higher to ensure smooth integration.

##Adding tvOS SDK

###Connecting Your App
There are two ways to add Color to your Xcode project:

####1. Cocoapods
Easily add Color to your project by adding the following code to your Podfile:

```
pod 'Color-tvOS-SDK'
```

After adding this value, run `pod install` and the latest version of our tvOS SDk will be installed!

####2. Manual Integration

[Download the tvOS SDK here](https://github.com/replaytv/Color-tvOS-SDK)

####Download & Unzip SDK 

Unzip and open the folder, then navigate to the ColorTV framework folder. Included are both frameworks for simulator and actual devices. Use the framework from the tvos-device folder for production, **only** use the framework for simulator for testing. 

Click on your Application at the top-left side of Xcode and go to project settings. Select *General* and choose proper target, it name in most cases corresponds to name of your project. Then drag and drop the COLORAdFramework.framework directory into the **Embeded Binaries** section.

![Importing Framework](https://github.com/color-tv/colortv-docs/blob/master/colortv/docs/images/add_framework_tvOS.gif)

Once complete, you will see the COLORAdFramework in both the **Embedded Binaries and Linked Frameworks and Libraries** sections. Please note that the framework will be automatically added to **Linked Frameworks and Libraries**. It will **not** be automatically added to both if you add it to Linked Frameworks and Libraries first.

##Initializing SDK

Open AppDelegate.m and modify body of function `application:DidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` with the App ID generated in the dashboard

```objective-c
[[COLORAdController sharedAdController] startWithAppIdentifier:@"YOUR_APP_ID_HERE"];
```

or in Swift:

```Swift
COLORAdController.sharedAdController().startWithAppIdentifier("YOUR_APP_ID_HERE");
```

Remember to import COLORAdFramework module. Add following line of code above class implementation.

```objective-c
@import COLORAdFramework;
```

Swift:

```Swift
@import COLORAdFramework
```

##Displaying ads

ColorTV offers lot of different types of advertisement which are automatically provided by our server inÂ order to attract you audience. You do not need to care about proper ad and its content, we optimize the best performing content for all of your users. All you need to do is to add a few lines of code and an ad will be displayed wherever and whenever you want.

```objective-c
    [[COLORAdController sharedAdController] adViewControllerForPlacement:COLORAdFrameworkPlacementAppLaunch withCompletion:^(COLORAdViewController * _Nullable vc, NSError * _Nullable error) {
        if(vc) {
            
            vc.adCompleted = ^{
                dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
                });
            };
            
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
                [self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:^{
                    
                }];
            });
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Error: %@", error);
        }        
    }];
```

Swift:

```Swift
    RPLTAdController.sharedAdController().adViewControllerWithCompletion({ (vc , error) in
            
        if((error) != nil) {
            NSLog("ERROR: %@", error!);
        }
            
        if((vc) != nil) {
            vc?.adCompleted = {
                self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: { () -> Void in
                        
                });
            };
                
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), { () -> Void in
                self.presentViewController(vc!, animated: true, completion: { () -> Void in
                        
                });
            });
        }
    });
```

We understand how imporant user experience is to your app's performance. Nobody wants to wait a few seconds to see an advertisement regardless how relevant it's content is, so we developed the method `adViewControllerWithCompletion` for optimal performance. Call `adViewControllerWithCompletion` whenever you think an ad is likely to be shown. We highly reccommend invoking this method in all potential places you will show an ad. By doing this you can decide to either stop or start showing ads at specific placements in your app via our dashboard without pushing updates to your users! 

Completion block is called when some elements of ad are loaded. It provides you two arguments, `viewController` and `error`. The framework generates `viewController` which is to be displayed in the manner which matches your application's structure. In most cases modal view controller is OK but sometimes navigation view controller or some kind if embedded view controller will be better. It is up to you.

When the ad should no longer be displayed you will be informed and need to define completion block. In the example above that controller is simply dismissed from screen.

Please note that majority of operations are done on the background threads while interactions with User Interface are only made on the main thread. Remember to use `[NSThread mainThread]` (old style) or main queue from GCD (new style) when interacting with UI.

##Placements

When showing an ad you must provide the context inside your app where you are showing the ad. It will allow us to target ads more effectively and give you the ability to control the ads shown in the dashboard.

```objective-c
[[COLORAdController sharedAdController] setCurrentPlacement:COLORAdFrameworkPlacementStageOpen];
```

Swift:

```Swift
RPLTAdController.sharedAdController().currentPlacement = RPLTAdFrameworkPlacementMainMenu;
```

The predefined values available as constants whose names start with COLORAdFrameworkPlacement...

##User Profile

Another way to provide valuable information which allows us to provide suitable ads to your audience is user profile. You can provide basic information which characterise specific user by setting properties of `COLORUserProfile` Singleton. If for some reason you believe that user of your application has changed, e.g. account is switched call `-(void)reset` method and set new values.
Property `age` is an unsigned integer which represent number of years elapsed since user was born. If you do not know exact value but you are able to predict age range pass number in the middle of predicted range.
Property `gender` is a string literal which should contain `male` of `female`.
Additionally set of keywords may be added in order to let us know something more about user of your app. You can manipulate keywords by calling methods `-(void)addKeyword:(NSString*)keyword` and `-(void)removeKeyword:(NSString*)keyword`. If profile is reseted collection of keywords becomes empty.

```objective-c
COLORUserProfile *profile = [COLORUserProfile sharedProfile];

[profile reset]; //reset current profile if user is switched in your application.

profile.age = 30;
profile.gender = @"female"; //male or female are expected here

//keywords which may charactirize your audience. It is used to better target ad.
[profile addKeyword:@"aviation"];
[profile addKeyword:@"airplane"];
[profile addKeyword:@"airport"];
```

##Earning Virtual Currency

Integrating virtual currency inside of your advertisments greatly increases user interaction as well as monetization for your app. We offer a mechanism to provide users a variety of incentives using your app's virtual currency. Virtual Currency must first be set up in the dashboard for your application and then a few lines of code need to be added to be fully setup.

Ad conversions are monitored by our server and you will be informed when some currency is assigned. It is up to you whether you prefer to get the notification through NSNotificationCenter or use delegate pattern.

####NSNotificationCenter

```objective-c
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:COLORAdFrameworkNotificationDidGetCurrency object:nil queue:nil usingBlock:^(NSNotification * _Nonnull note) {
    NSLog(@"userInfo: %@", note);
}];
```

Each time a conversion is registered (usually when application returns to foreground) a notification will be triggered for each conversion. Note is an object of class NSNotification which contains property userInfo of class NSDictionary. It contains some useful information like amount of currency to be assigned or name of the currency.

####Delegate

If you prefer to use delegates please remember to set desired class as compliant to COLORAdControllerDelegate protocol. Then set the delegate.

```objective-c
[COLORAdController sharedAdController].delegate = self;
```

Whenever a conversion is registered, the following method is to be called. Details contains the same information as userInfo.

```objective-c
#pragma mark - COLORAdControllerDelegate

-(void)didGetCurrency:(NSDictionary *)details {
    NSLog(@"didGetcurrency delegate method: %@", details);
}
```
